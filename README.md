# Linear-Algebra

Some coding questions I did while taking the course Linear Algebra

Gaussian Elinimation : Implemented a basic Gaussian Elimination algorithm, and compare the runtime complexity of the algorithm with that of a library imple-mentation.Plotted my results on a graph to observe interesting features/trends.

Gram-Schmidt: Implemented a basic Gram-Schmidt factorisation for an arbitrary mxn matrix.A library implementation was used to establish the runtime complexity of the QR factorisation.
